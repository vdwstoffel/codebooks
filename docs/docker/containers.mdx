# Docker Containers: Running Your Applications

Docker containers are lightweight, standalone, and executable packages that encapsulate an application and everything it needs to run: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. They provide a consistent and isolated environment, ensuring that your application works uniformly regardless of where it's deployed.

## Container vs. Image

It's crucial to understand the distinction between an **image** and a **container**:

-   **Docker Image:** A read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. It's like a blueprint or a class.
-   **Docker Container:** A runnable instance of a Docker image. It's like an object created from a class. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container.

## Running a Container: `docker run`

The `docker run` command is used to create and start a new container from a Docker image. It's one of the most frequently used Docker commands.

```bash
docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]
```

Here are some common `docker run` options:

-   **`-d` (Detached mode):** Runs the container in the background.
    ```bash
    docker run -d my-image
    ```

-   **`-p <host_port>:<container_port>` (Port mapping):** Maps a port on your host machine to a port inside the container.
    ```bash
    docker run -p 80:8080 my-web-app
    ```

-   **`--name <container_name>` (Name):** Assigns a custom name to your container, making it easier to reference.
    ```bash
    docker run --name my-app-instance my-app
    ```

-   **`--rm` (Remove):** Automatically removes the container when it exits. Useful for temporary containers.
    ```bash
    docker run --rm my-temp-container
    ```

-   **`-e <KEY=VALUE>` (Environment variables):** Sets environment variables inside the container.
    ```bash
    docker run -e NODE_ENV=production my-node-app
    ```

-   **`-v <host_path>:<container_path>` (Volume mounting):** Mounts a host directory or file into the container. Useful for persistent data or live development.
    ```bash
    docker run -v /path/on/host:/path/in/container my-app
    ```

-   **`-it` (Interactive TTY):** Runs the container in interactive mode and allocates a pseudo-TTY. Often used for shell access.
    ```bash
    docker run -it ubuntu bash
    ```

## Container Lifecycle

Docker containers go through various states:

-   **Created:** The container has been created but not started.
-   **Running:** The container is executing its processes.
-   **Paused:** The container's processes have been suspended.
-   **Stopped:** The container's processes have been gracefully shut down.
-   **Deleted:** The container has been removed from the Docker host.

## Managing Containers

Here are essential commands for managing your running and stopped containers:

-   **List Running Containers:**
    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```

-   **List All Containers (including stopped):**
    ```bash
    docker ps -a
    ```

-   **Stop a Container:** Gracefully stops a running container.
    ```bash
    docker stop my-container
    ```

-   **Start a Container:** Starts a stopped container.
    ```bash
    docker start my-container
    ```

-   **Restart a Container:** Stops and then starts a container.
    ```bash
    docker restart my-container
    ```

-   **Remove a Container:** Deletes a stopped container. Use `-f` to force removal of a running container.
    ```bash
    docker rm my-container
    # Force remove
    docker rm -f my-running-container
    ```

-   **View Container Logs:** Shows the output from a container's `STDOUT` and `STDERR`.
    ```bash
    docker logs my-container
    ```

-   **Execute Command in Running Container:** Runs a command inside a running container.
    ```bash
    docker exec -it my-container bash
    ```

## Best Practices for Containers

-   **Keep Containers Ephemeral:** Design containers so they can be stopped and destroyed, then rebuilt and replaced with a minimal setup and configuration.
-   **One Process Per Container:** Ideally, each container should run only one concern. This promotes modularity and easier scaling.
-   **Use Volumes for Persistent Data:** Don't store important data inside the container's writable layer. Use Docker volumes to persist data.
-   **Minimize Image Size:** Smaller images are faster to build, pull, and push. Use multi-stage builds and alpine-based images where possible.
