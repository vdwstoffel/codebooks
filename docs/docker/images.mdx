# Images


Docker Images are the building blocks of a Docker container. They are created with the build command, and they are used to create containers.

## How to create an image

```dockerfile title="dockerfile"
FROM node:latest

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json .

RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000

CMD [ "npm", "run", "start" ]
```

```bash
docker build -t node-docker-demo:dev .
```

    <TabItem value="Script">

        ```bash title="docker_run.sh"
        #!/bin/bash
        # Specifies that this script should be run using the Bash shell.

        dos2unix mvnw
        # Converts the 'mvnw' file to Unix format by fixing line endings (from DOS/Windows to Unix).

        # Runs the 'mvnw' (Maven Wrapper) script with the following commands:
        # - 'clean': Deletes all build artifacts to ensure a clean build environment.
        # - 'spring-boot:run': Starts the Spring Boot application.
        # The '&' runs this process in the background, allowing the script to proceed without waiting.
        ./mvnw clean spring-boot:run &

        # Starts an infinite loop that will continuously execute the commands inside it.
        while true; do

        # Monitors the 'src/' directory recursively for any of the following events:
        # - 'modify': A file is modified.
        # - 'create': A file is created.
        # - 'delete': A file is deleted.
        # - 'move': A file is moved.
        # The script will pause and wait here until any of these events occur.
        inotifywait -e modify,create,delete,move -r ./src/

        # Once a change is detected, this command compiles the source code using Maven,
        # incorporating the changes into the application.
        ./mvnw compile

        done
        # Ends the 'while' loop and makes the process repeat indefinitely.
