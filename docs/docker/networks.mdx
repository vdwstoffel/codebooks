# Docker Networks: Enabling Container Communication

Docker networking allows containers to communicate with each other and with the outside world. Docker provides several network drivers, each suited for different use cases.

## Why Docker Networks?

-   **Isolation:** Networks provide isolation between groups of containers.
-   **Communication:** Enable seamless communication between containers, even across different hosts.
-   **Service Discovery:** Containers can find each other by name within a network.
-   **Security:** Control which containers can communicate with each other.

## Common Network Drivers

Docker offers several built-in network drivers:

-   **`bridge` (Default):** The default network driver. Containers on the same bridge network can communicate with each other. Containers not on the bridge network cannot communicate with each other.
-   **`host`:** Removes network isolation between the container and the Docker host. The container shares the host's network stack.
-   **`none`:** Disables all networking for the container. Only the loopback interface is available.
-   **`overlay`:** Creates a distributed network among multiple Docker daemon hosts. Used for swarm services.
-   **`macvlan`:** Assigns a MAC address to a container, making it appear as a physical device on your network.

## Creating Custom Networks

It's a best practice to create custom bridge networks for your applications. This provides better isolation and enables automatic service discovery by container name.

**Create a Custom Bridge Network:**

```bash
docker network create my_app_network
```

**List Networks:**

```bash
docker network ls
```

**Inspect a Network:**

```bash
docker network inspect my_app_network
```

## Connecting Containers to a Network

### During Container Creation

You can connect a container to a custom network when you run it using the `--network` flag.

```bash
docker run -d --name web_server --network my_app_network nginx
docker run -d --name api_server --network my_app_network my_api_image
```

Containers `web_server` and `api_server` can now communicate with each other using their names (e.g., `web_server` can reach `api_server` at `http://api_server`).

### Connecting an Existing Container

You can connect a running container to a network using `docker network connect`.

```bash
docker network connect my_app_network existing_container_name
```

### Disconnecting a Container

```bash
docker network disconnect my_app_network my_container_name
```

## Example: Web Application with Database on a Custom Network

This example demonstrates how to set up a web application and a database on a custom bridge network using `docker run` commands.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Commands" label="Commands">

-   **Create a custom network:**
    ```bash
    docker network create my_web_db_network
    ```

-   **Run the database container on the network:**
    ```bash
    docker run -d --name my_db --network my_web_db_network \
      -e POSTGRES_DB=mydb \
      -e POSTGRES_USER=user \
      -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password \
      postgres:13
    ```

-   **Run the web application container on the network:**
    ```bash
    docker run -d --name my_web_app --network my_web_db_network \
      -p 80:80 \
      nginx
    ```

-   **Verify communication (from web_app to db):**
    ```bash
    docker exec my_web_app ping -c 3 my_db
    ```

-   **Clean up:**
    ```bash
    docker stop my_web_app my_db
    docker rm my_web_app my_db
    docker network rm my_web_db_network
    ```
