# SELECT

## Select all columns

```sql
SELECT * FROM "users";
```

## Select specific columns

```sql
SELECT "name", "email" FROM "users";
```

## Select unique records

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "age" FROM "users"
```

## Select records with a condition

```sql
SELECT * FROM "users"
WHERE "subscribed" = 'true';
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM "users"
WHERE "age" > 30;
```

## Select records with multiple conditions

```sql
SELECT * FROM "users"
WHERE "subscribed" = 'false'
AND "age" < 40;
```

## Select within range

```sql
SELECT * FROM "users"
WHERE "age" BETWEEN 18 AND 30;
```

## Order Results

```sql
SELECT * FROM "users"
ORDER BY "name" ASC;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM "users"
ORDER BY "name" DESC;
```

## Limit Results

```sql
SELECT * FROM "users"
LIMIT 3;
```

## Selecting Patterns

`%` : Zero, one, or multiple characters

`_` : Single character

```sql
SELECT * FROM "users"
WHERE "email" LIKE '%@gmail.com';
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM "users"
WHERE "name" LIKE 'J%';
```
