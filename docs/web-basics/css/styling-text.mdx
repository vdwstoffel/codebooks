# Styling Text

When styling text with CSS, there are several properties that are commonly used to control the appearance of text on a web page. These properties allow you to adjust everything from the color and size of the text to its alignment and spacing.

## Common CSS Properties for Text

Below is a list of the most common CSS properties for styling text, along with a brief description of what each property does.

| Property          | Description                                                                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `color`           | Sets the color of the text.                                                          |
| `font-size`       | Specifies the size of the text.                                                      |
