# Objects in JavaScript

Objects are fundamental to JavaScript and are used to store collections of data and more complex entities. An object is a collection of **key-value pairs**, where keys (also called property names) are strings (or Symbols) and values can be any data type, including other objects or functions.

## Creating Objects

### Object Literal (Most Common)

This is the simplest and most common way to create an object.

```javascript
let person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    age: 30,
    isStudent: false,
    hobbies: ["reading", "hiking"],
    address: {
        street: "123 Main St",
        city: "Anytown"
    },
    greet: function() {
        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.firstName}`);
    }
};
```

### Object Constructor

You can also create an empty object using the `Object` constructor and then add properties.

```javascript
let car = new Object();
car.make = "Toyota";
car.model = "Camry";
car.year = 2020;
```

## Accessing Object Properties

There are two main ways to access properties of an object:

### Dot Notation (Preferred for known property names)

```javascript
console.log(person.firstName); // "John"
console.log(person.address.city); // "Anytown"
person.greet(); // "Hello, my name is John"
```

### Bracket Notation (Useful for dynamic property names or names with spaces/special characters)

```javascript
console.log(person["lastName"]); // "Doe"
let propName = "age";
console.log(person[propName]); // 30
```

## Modifying and Adding Properties

Properties can be modified or added by assigning a new value.

```javascript
person.age = 31; // Modifying an existing property
person.email = "john.doe@example.com"; // Adding a new property
```

## Deleting Properties

Use the `delete` operator to remove a property from an object.

```javascript
delete person.isStudent;
```

## Iterating Over Object Properties

### `for...in` Loop

Iterates over enumerable string properties of an object. It also iterates over properties in the prototype chain, so it's often used with `hasOwnProperty()`.

```javascript
for (let key in person) {
    if (person.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
        console.log(`${key}: ${person[key]}`);
    }
}
```

### `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, `Object.entries()` (ES6+)

These methods return arrays, allowing you to use array iteration methods (`forEach`, `map`, `filter`, etc.).

-   `Object.keys(obj)`: Returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names.
-   `Object.values(obj)`: Returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property values.
-   `Object.entries(obj)`: Returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property `[key, value]` pairs.

```javascript
console.log(Object.keys(person));   // ["firstName", "lastName", "age", ...]
console.log(Object.values(person)); // ["John", "Doe", 30, ...]

for (let [key, value] of Object.entries(person)) {
    console.log(`${key}: ${value}`);
}
```

## Object Destructuring (ES6+)

Destructuring assignment allows you to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.

```javascript
const { firstName, age } = person;
console.log(firstName); // "John"
console.log(age);       // 30

// With a different variable name
const { lastName: surname } = person;
console.log(surname); // "Doe"

// With default values
const { city = "Unknown" } = person;
console.log(city); // "Unknown" (if person.city is undefined)
```

## The `this` Keyword

In JavaScript, the value of `this` depends on how the function is called. When a function is a method of an object, `this` refers to the object that the method belongs to.

```javascript
const user = {
    name: "Alice",
    greet: function() {
        console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}`); // `this` refers to `user`
    }
};
user.greet(); // "Hello, Alice"

const anotherUser = {
    name: "Bob",
    greet: person.greet // Borrowing the greet method
};
anotherUser.greet(); // "Hello, Bob" (this refers to anotherUser)
```

## Prototypes and Inheritance (Briefly)

JavaScript objects have a special hidden property called `[[Prototype]]` (or `__proto__`). This is how JavaScript objects inherit features from one another. When you try to access a property or method on an object, if it's not found on the object itself, JavaScript looks up the prototype chain.

```javascript
const animal = {
    eats: true,
    walk() {
        console.log("Animal walks");
    }
};

const rabbit = {
    jumps: true,
    __proto__: animal // Set animal as prototype
};

rabbit.walk(); // "Animal walks" (inherited from animal)
console.log(rabbit.eats); // true (inherited from animal)
```

This is a very brief introduction to prototypes. For more complex inheritance patterns, ES6 Classes provide a more familiar syntax over the prototype chain.
