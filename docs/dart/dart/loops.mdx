# Dart Loops

Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly.

## For Loop

A `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence of numbers.

```dart
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  print(i); // 0 1 2 3 4
}
```

## For-In Loop

A `for-in` loop is used to iterate over the elements of a collection.

```dart
List<String> fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange'];
for (String fruit in fruits) {
  print(fruit); // Apple Banana Orange
}
```

## ForEach Loop

The `forEach` method can be used to iterate over the elements of a collection.

```dart
List<String> fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange'];
fruits.forEach((fruit) => print(fruit)); // Apple Banana Orange
```

## While Loop

A `while` loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

```dart
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  print(i); // 0 1 2 3 4
  i++;
}
```
