# Dart I/O

In Dart, you can perform I/O operations using the `dart:io` library. This library provides classes for working with files, directories, sockets, processes, and more.

## Reading User Input from the Console

To read input from the console, you can use the `stdin.readLineSync()` function from the `dart:io` library. This is a synchronous call that blocks execution until the user provides input.

### Example

Here's an example of how to read a line of text from the user:

```dart
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  print('Enter your name:');
  String? name = stdin.readLineSync();
  print('Hello, $name!');
}
```

Since `stdin.readLineSync()` can return `null` if there's no more input, the variable `name` is of type `String?`.
