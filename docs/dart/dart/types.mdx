# Dart Types

Dart is a statically-typed language, which means that the type of a variable is known at compile time. However, you can also declare variables without a type and let Dart infer it.

## Type Casting

Type casting is the process of converting a variable from one type to another. In Dart, you can use the `as` keyword to perform a type cast.

```dart
Object maybeString = 'hello';
String myString = maybeString as String;
```

If the object is not of the specified type, a `CastError` will be thrown.

## Type Checking

You can check the type of an object at runtime using the `is` keyword. This is a safe way to check a type before casting.

```dart
Object maybeInt = 123;

if (maybeInt is int) {
  int myInt = maybeInt;
  print(myInt); // 123
}
```

You can also use `is!` to check if an object is *not* of a certain type.

```dart
Object maybeDouble = 45.6;

if (maybeDouble is! String) {
  print('Not a string!'); // Not a string!
}
```
