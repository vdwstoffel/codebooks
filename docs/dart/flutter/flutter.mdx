# Flutter

<DisplayLogo logo="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Google-flutter-logo.svg/1920px-Google-flutter-logo.svg.png" />

[Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/) is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase.

The first version of Flutter was known as "Sky" and ran on the Android operating system. It was unveiled at the 2015 Dart developer summit, with the stated intent of being able to render consistently at 120 frames per second.

## Key Features

- **Fast Development:** Flutter's hot reload feature helps you quickly and easily experiment, build UIs, add features, and fix bugs faster.
- **Expressive and Flexible UI:** Flutter's layered architecture allows for full customization, which results in incredibly fast rendering and expressive and flexible designs.
- **Native Performance:** Flutterâ€™s widgets incorporate all critical platform differences such as scrolling, navigation, icons, and fonts to provide full native performance on both iOS and Android.

## Creating and Running a Flutter App

### Create the App

To create a new Flutter app, use the `flutter create` command, followed by the name of your app.

```bash
flutter create my_app
```

This will create a new directory called `my_app` with a simple demo app inside.

### Run the App

To run the app, first change into the new directory:

```bash
cd my_app
```

Then, use the `flutter run` command.

```bash
flutter run
```

This will launch the app in a simulator or on a connected device.

## Hello World

Here is an example of a bare-bones Flutter app that displays the text "Hello World".

```dart title="main.dart"
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return const MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Hello World'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Importing Files

As your app grows, it's a good practice to split your code into multiple files. Here is an example of how to create a separate file for a widget and import it into your main file.

<Tabs>

  <TabItem value="main.dart" label="main.dart" default>

    ```dart title="main.dart"
    import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
    import 'my_widget.dart'; // highlight-next-line

    void main() {
      runApp(const MyApp());
    }

    class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
      const MyApp({super.key});

      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return const MaterialApp(
          home: Scaffold(
            body: Center(
              child: MyWidget(),
            ),
          ),
        );
      }
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="my_widget.dart" label="my_widget.dart">

    ```dart title="my_widget.dart"
    import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

    class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
      const MyWidget({super.key});

      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return const Text('Hello from a separate file!');
      }
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>
