# Working with 3rd Party Packages

The official package repository for Dart and Flutter is [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/). You can find packages for almost anything you need there.

To add a package to your Flutter app, you can use the `flutter pub add` command. For example, to add the `google_fonts` package, you would run the following command:

## Google Fonts


```bash title="terminal"
flutter pub add google_fonts
```

This will add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
dependencies:
  google_fonts: ^2.1.0
```

To use the `google_fonts` package, you first need to import it in your Dart file.

```dart
import 'package:google_fonts/google_fonts.dart';

// rest of the code

Text(
  'This is Google Fonts',
  style: GoogleFonts.lato(),
);
```
