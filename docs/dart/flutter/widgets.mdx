# Flutter Widgets

Flutter widgets are the basic building blocks of a Flutter app's user interface. Each widget is an immutable declaration of part of the user interface.

| Category | Widgets |
| :--- | :--- |
| Layout | Row, Column, Scaffold, Stack |
| Structures | Button, Toast, MenuDrawer |
| Styles | TextStyle, Color, Padding |
| Animations | FadeInPhoto, transformations |
| Positioning and alignment | Center, Padding |

## Basic Stateless Widget Example

Here is an example of a bare minimum Flutter widget that displays "Hello, world!":

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class HelloWorld extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: Text('Hello, world!'),
    );
  }
}
```
