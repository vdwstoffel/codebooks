# Flutter Widgets

Flutter widgets are the basic building blocks of a Flutter app's user interface. Each widget is an immutable declaration of part of the user interface.

## Common Widgets

### Layout

| Widget    | Description                                                                          |
| :-------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scaffold  | Implements the basic material design visual layout structure.                        |
| Row       | A widget that displays its children in a horizontal array.                           |
| Column    | A widget that displays its children in a vertical array.                             |
| Stack     | A widget that positions its children relative to the edges of its box.               |
| Container | A convenience widget that combines common painting, positioning, and sizing widgets. |

### Positioning and alignment

| Widget  | Description                                        |
| :------ | :------------------------------------------------- |
| Center  | A widget that centers its child within itself.     |
| Padding | A widget that insets its child by a given padding. |

### Structures

| Widget     | Description                                                                                                                 |
| :--------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Button     | A material design button. Ex, `TextButton`, `ElevatedButton`, `OutlinedButton`                                              |
| Toast      | A lightweight message that briefly appears on screen.                                                                       |
| MenuDrawer | A material design panel that slides in horizontally from the edge of a Scaffold to show navigation links in an application. |
| Text       | A run of text with a single style.                                                                                          |

### Styles

| Widget    | Description                                                 |
| :-------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| TextStyle | An immutable style describing how to format and paint text. |
| Color     | An immutable 32-bit color value in ARGB format.             |

### Animations

| Widget          | Description                                                                                  |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| FadeInPhoto     | A widget that displays a placeholder while an image is loading, then fades in the new image. |
| Transformations | A widget that applies a transformation to its child.                                         |

## Basic Stateless Widget Example

Here is an example of a bare minimum Flutter widget that displays "Hello, world!":

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class HelloWorld extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: Text('Hello, world!'),
    );
  }
}
```

## Stateless Widget with a Widget Argument

Here is an example of a stateless widget that takes another widget as an argument in its constructor. This is a common pattern for creating reusable layout components.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class CustomCard extends StatelessWidget {
  final Widget child;

  const CustomCard({Key? key, required this.child}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      decoration: BoxDecoration(
        color: Colors.white,
        borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8.0),
        boxShadow: [
          BoxShadow(
            color: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.1),
            blurRadius: 4,
            offset: const Offset(0, 2),
          ),
        ],
      ),
      child: child,
    );
  }
}
```

To use this `CustomCard` widget, you would pass another widget to its `child` property:

```dart
CustomCard(
  child: Text('This is inside the card'),
)
```

## Combining Widgets

You can build complex UIs by combining multiple widgets. Here's an example of a `Column` widget that holds two `Text` widgets.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class SimpleLayout extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Combining Widgets'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Hello,'),
            Text('World!'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Images

To add assets like images to your Flutter application, you need to declare them in your `pubspec.yaml` file.

First, create an `assets` folder in the root of your project and add your images to it. For example, you can create a folder `assets/images` and add a file named `my_image.png`.

Then, open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following to the `flutter` section:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
```

This will make all the images in the `assets/images` folder available in your application.

### Using the Image

Once you have added the assets to your `pubspec.yaml` file, you can use them in your application using the `Image` widget in two ways:

1.  `Image(image: AssetImage('path/to/image.png'))`
2.  `Image.asset('path/to/image.png')`

Here is an example of how to use both:

```dart title="main.dart"
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return const MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Image(image: AssetImage('assets/images/dice-1.png')),
              Image.asset('assets/images/dice-2.png'),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
