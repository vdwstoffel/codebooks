# Spring Security

```xml title="pom.xml"
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
Once you start the server in the cli you will see

```shell
Using generated security password: 5f467679-b717-4341-ad48-9125a1dd1700

This generated password is for development use only. Your security configuration must be updated before running your application in production.
```

By default the user is `user` and the password is the generated password.

You can use this password to login to the application. You can also set your own password by adding the following line to the `application.properties` file

```properties title="application.properties"
spring.security.user.name=admin
spring.security.user.password=admin
```
