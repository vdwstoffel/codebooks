# Databases

When it comes to working with databases in Spring Boot, there are two main approaches: Spring Data JPA and Spring Data REST.

## Spring Data JPA

Spring Data JPA provides a simple and consistent way to interact with your database. It allows you to create repositories that handle the boilerplate code for CRUD operations, so you can focus on your business logic.

## Spring Data REST

Spring Data REST takes it a step further and automatically exposes your repositories as RESTful endpoints. This can save you a significant amount of time when building APIs.
