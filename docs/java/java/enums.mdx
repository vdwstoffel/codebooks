# Enums in Java

An **enum** (short for "enumeration") is a special type that represents a fixed set of constants. Enums are used when you have a variable that can only take one of a small, predefined set of possible values, such as the days of the week, the seasons of the year, or the planets in our solar system.

Using enums improves type safety, meaning you can't assign an invalid value to a variable of an enum type.

## Defining a Basic Enum

You define an enum using the `enum` keyword. The constants are listed in uppercase letters.

```java
public enum Level {
    LOW,
    MEDIUM,
    HIGH
}
```

## Using an Enum

You can declare variables of the enum type and use the constants in your code, for example, in a `switch` statement.

```java
Level myLevel = Level.MEDIUM;

switch(myLevel) {
    case LOW:
        // System.out.println("Low level");
        break;
    case MEDIUM:
        // System.out.println("Medium level");
        break;
    case HIGH:
        // System.out.println("High level");
        break;
}
// Output:
// Medium level
```

## Enums with Fields and Methods

Unlike in many other languages, enums in Java are much more powerful. They are a special kind of class and can have fields, constructors, and methods.

This allows you to associate data and behavior with each constant.

### Example: Enum with a Constructor and Method

Here's an example of a `ShirtSize` enum where each size has an associated abbreviation.

```java
public enum ShirtSize {
    // The constants call the constructor
    SMALL("S"),
    MEDIUM("M"),
    LARGE("L"),
    EXTRA_LARGE("XL");

    // Field for each enum constant
    private final String abbreviation;

    // Constructor for the enum
    // Note: Enum constructors are implicitly private
    ShirtSize(String abbreviation) {
        this.abbreviation = abbreviation;
    }

    // Method for the enum
    public String getAbbreviation() {
        return this.abbreviation;
    }
}

// --- How to use it ---
ShirtSize size = ShirtSize.LARGE;

String abbr = size.getAbbreviation(); // "L"
String name = size.name();            // "LARGE" (built-in method)
int ordinal = size.ordinal();         // 2 (position in the enum declaration, starts at 0)
```

## Iterating Over Enum Constants

You can loop through all the constants of an enum using the built-in `values()` method.

```java
for (ShirtSize size : ShirtSize.values()) {
    // System.out.println(size + " (" + size.getAbbreviation() + ")");
}
// Output:
// SMALL (S)
// MEDIUM (M)
// LARGE (L)
// EXTRA_LARGE (XL)
```
