# Inheritance in Java

Inheritance is one of the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows a class (the **subclass** or **child class**) to inherit fields and methods from another class (the **superclass** or **parent class**).

This creates an "is-a" relationship (e.g., a `Dog` is an `Animal`). The main benefits are **code reusability** and establishing a clear class hierarchy.

## Extending a Class

You use the `extends` keyword to create a subclass.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Parent" label="Animal.java">

```java title="Animal.java"
// Superclass
public class Animal {
    String name;

    public Animal(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void eat() {
        System.out.println(name + " is eating.");
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Child" label="Dog.java">

```java title="Dog.java"
// Subclass
public class Dog extends Animal {
    public Dog(String name) {
        // Call the constructor of the superclass
        super(name);
    }

    public void bark() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Main" label="Main.java">

```java title="Main.java"
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog myDog = new Dog("Buddy");
        myDog.eat();  // Inherited from Animal class
        myDog.bark(); // Defined in Dog class
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## The `super` Keyword

The `super` keyword is used to refer to the immediate parent class object.

1.  **To call the superclass constructor:** `super()` must be the very first statement in the subclass constructor.
2.  **To access superclass members:** `super.methodName()` or `super.fieldName` can be used if the subclass has members with the same name.

## Method Overriding

A subclass can provide its own specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. This is known as method overriding.

**Rules for Overriding:**
- The method must have the same name, return type, and parameters as in the parent class.
- It cannot have a more restrictive access modifier (e.g., you cannot override a `public` method with a `private` one).
- The `@Override` annotation should be used to indicate that you are intentionally overriding a method. This helps the compiler catch errors.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Parent" label="Animal.java">

```java title="Animal.java"
public class Animal {
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Some generic animal sound");
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Child" label="Cat.java">

```java title="Cat.java"
public class Cat extends Animal {
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Meow!");
    }
}
```

## Types of Inheritance

Java supports the following types of inheritance:

1.  **Single Inheritance:** A class inherits from only one superclass. (e.g., `Dog extends Animal`)
2.  **Multilevel Inheritance:** A class inherits from a subclass, creating a chain. (e.g., `Puppy extends Dog`, and `Dog extends Animal`)
3.  **Hierarchical Inheritance:** Multiple classes inherit from a single superclass. (e.g., `Dog extends Animal` and `Cat extends Animal`)

**Note:** Java does **not** support **multiple inheritance** with classes (a class cannot extend more than one class). This is to avoid the "diamond problem." However, a class can implement multiple interfaces to achieve a form of multiple inheritance.

## The `final` Keyword

The `final` keyword can be used to restrict inheritance.

-   **`final` class:** A `final` class cannot be extended (subclassed).
    ```java
    public final class SecureSystem { /* ... */ }
    // public class MaliciousSubclass extends SecureSystem {} // This will cause a compile error
    ```
-   **`final` method:** A `final` method cannot be overridden by a subclass.
    ```java
    public class Parent {
        public final void lockMethod() { /* ... */ }
    }
    
    public class Child extends Parent {
        // @Override
        // public void lockMethod() {} // This will cause a compile error
    }
    ```
