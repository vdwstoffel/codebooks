Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language known for its platform independence. Developed by Sun Microsystems and now owned by Oracle, it's one of the most popular languages for building everything from web applications to mobile apps and large-scale enterprise systems.

## Core Philosophy: "Write Once, Run Anywhere"

The key to Java's portability is the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**. Here’s how it works:

1.  You write your code in a `.java` file.
2.  The Java compiler (`javac`) compiles your source code into **bytecode**, which is stored in a `.class` file.
3.  This bytecode is not specific to any operating system. Instead, the JVM on any device (Windows, macOS, Linux) can interpret and run this bytecode.

This process allows a Java application to be developed on one system and run on any other system that has a JVM, without needing to be recompiled.

## Your First Java Program: Hello, World!

Here is the classic "Hello, World!" program. It's the simplest program you can write, and it demonstrates the basic structure of a Java application.

```java title="HelloWorld.java"
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // This line prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

### Breakdown of the Code

-   `public class HelloWorld`: Every Java application must have at least one class. A class is a blueprint for creating objects. `HelloWorld` is the name of our class.
-   `public static void main(String[] args)`: This is the **main method**. It's the entry point of your application—the code inside this method is what gets executed when you run the program.
-   `System.out.println("Hello, World!")`: This is a statement that prints the text "Hello, World!" to the console, followed by a new line.

## How to Compile and Run

To run this program, you first need to compile the `.java` file into a `.class` file using the Java compiler, `javac`. Then, you use the `java` command to execute the compiled bytecode.

```bash
# 1. Compile the source code
javac HelloWorld.java

# 2. Run the compiled bytecode
java HelloWorld

# Output:
# Hello, World!
```

## What's Next?

Now that you understand the basic structure of a Java program, you can explore the core features of the language in the following sections, including:

-   **[Strings](./string.mdx):** How to work with text.
-   **[Numbers](./numbers.mdx):** Handling integers, decimals, and mathematical operations.
-   **[Arrays & Lists](./arrays.mdx):** Storing and managing collections of data.
-   **[Loops](./loops.mdx):** Repeating blocks of code.
-   **[Maps](./maps.mdx):** Storing data as key-value pairs.
-   **[Methods (Functions)](./functions.mdx):** Defining and calling reusable blocks of code.
-   **[Classes & Objects](./classes.mdx):** The blueprints for creating objects.
-   **[Inheritance](./inheritance.mdx):** How classes can inherit from each other.
-   **[Interfaces](./interfaces.mdx):** Defining contracts for classes.
-   **[Exception Handling](./error_handeling.mdx):** Managing runtime errors.
-   **[Enums](./enums.mdx):** Defining a fixed set of constants.
-   **[Dates and Times](./dates.mdx):** How to work with dates and times.
-   **[Switch](./switch.mdx):** Conditional logic with multiple branches.
-   **[I/O (Input/Output)](./io.mdx):** Reading from and writing to files and the console.
