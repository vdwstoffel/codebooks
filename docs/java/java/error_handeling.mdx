# Exception Handling in Java

Exception handling is a powerful mechanism that allows you to manage runtime errors in a structured way. An exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program. When an error occurs, Java throws an exception.

## Exception Hierarchy

In Java, all exceptions are subclasses of the `Throwable` class.

-   **Checked Exceptions:** These are exceptions that are checked at compile-time (e.g., `IOException`, `FileNotFoundException`). You **must** handle them using a `try-catch` block or declare them with the `throws` keyword.
-   **Unchecked Exceptions (Runtime Exceptions):** These are exceptions that occur at runtime (e.g., `NullPointerException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`). The compiler does not require you to handle them, but it's often good practice to do so.

## The `try-catch` Block

This is the fundamental way to handle exceptions. You place code that might throw an exception inside the `try` block and the handling logic inside the `catch` block.

```java
try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
    int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
    int x = numbers[5]; // This will throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
} catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
    // This block executes if the specified exception occurs
    // System.out.println("Error: Array index is out of bounds.");
    // e.printStackTrace(); // Prints the stack trace of the exception
}

// The program continues to run after the catch block.
```

## The `finally` Block

The `finally` block is optional and is always executed after the `try` and `catch` blocks, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or caught. It's typically used for cleanup code, like closing files or database connections.

```java
try {
    // ... some code ...
} catch (Exception e) {
    // ... handle exception ...
} finally {
    // This code will always run, for cleanup.
    // System.out.println("The 'finally' block has executed.");
}
```

## The `try-with-resources` Statement

Introduced in Java 7, this is the modern, preferred way to handle resources that need to be closed (like file streams or database connections). It automatically closes the resources for you, making the code cleaner and safer than using a `finally` block for cleanup.

```java
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Scanner;

// The resource (Scanner) is declared in the try() statement.
// It will be automatically closed.
try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new FileInputStream("greeting.txt"))) {
    // System.out.println(scanner.nextLine());
} catch (IOException e) {
    // System.out.println("Error reading file: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

## The `throws` and `throw` Keywords

### `throws`
The `throws` keyword is used in a method signature to declare that the method might throw one or more checked exceptions. It delegates the responsibility of handling the exception to the caller of the method.

```java
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;

// This method declares that it can throw a FileNotFoundException
public void readFile(String fileName) throws FileNotFoundException {
    // ... code that might throw the exception ...
}

// The caller must handle it
public void processFile() {
    try {
        readFile("test.txt");
    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
        // Handle the error here
    }
}
```

### `throw`
The `throw` keyword is used to manually throw an exception. This is often used for validating arguments or signaling an error state.

```java
public void setAge(int age) {
    if (age < 0) {
        // Manually throw an exception for invalid input
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Age cannot be negative.");
    }
    // ...
}

// Calling the method with invalid input
try {
    setAge(-5);
} catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
    // System.out.println(e.getMessage()); // "Age cannot be negative."
}
```
