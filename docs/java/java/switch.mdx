# Switch Statement

The `switch` statement is a control flow statement that allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values. Each value is called a case, and the variable being switched on is checked for each case.

## Basic Switch

The basic `switch` statement is simple to use but has some drawbacks, such as the need for `break` statements to prevent fall-through.

```java
int day = 3;

switch (day) {
    case 1:
        System.out.println("Monday"); // "Monday"
        break;
    case 2:
        System.out.println("Tuesday"); // "Tuesday"
        break;
    case 3:
        System.out.println("Wednesday"); // "Wednesday"
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println("Invalid day");
}
```

### Fall-through

Without a `break` statement, the `switch` will continue to execute the code in the following cases until a `break` is encountered. This is known as fall-through.

```java
int day = 3;

switch (day) {
    case 1:
    case 2:
    case 3:
    case 4:
    case 5:
        System.out.println("Weekday"); // "Weekday"
        break;
    case 6:
    case 7:
        System.out.println("Weekend"); // "Weekend"
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println("Invalid day");
}
```

## Using Switch with Strings

Since Java 7, you can use `String` objects in the `switch` statement.

```java
String day = "Wednesday";

switch (day) {
    case "Monday":
        System.out.println("Start of the work week");
        break;
    case "Wednesday":
        System.out.println("Midweek"); // "Midweek"
        break;
    case "Friday":
        System.out.println("End of the work week");
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println("Some other day");
}
```

## Using Switch with Enums

`switch` statements work well with `enum` types, providing a clean way to handle different enum constants.

```java
public enum Day {
    MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY
}

Day today = Day.WEDNESDAY;

switch (today) {
    case MONDAY:
        System.out.println("Mondays are tough.");
        break;
    case WEDNESDAY:
        System.out.println("Halfway through the week!"); // "Halfway through the week!"
        break;
    case SATURDAY:
    case SUNDAY:
        System.out.println("Weekends are the best!");
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println("Some other day.");
}
```

## Enhanced Switch and Switch Expressions (Java 14+)

Java 14 introduced enhanced `switch` statements and `switch` expressions, offering a more concise and readable syntax.

### Enhanced Switch Statement

The `->` operator simplifies `case` labels, eliminating the need for `break` statements and preventing fall-through issues.

```java
int day = 3;
switch (day) {
    case 1 -> System.out.println("Monday"); // "Monday"
    case 2 -> System.out.println("Tuesday"); // "Tuesday"
    case 3 -> System.out.println("Wednesday"); // "Wednesday"
    default -> System.out.println("Invalid day");
}
```

### Switch Expression

Switch expressions can return a value, making them useful for assigning values to variables. The `yield` keyword is used to return a value from a `case` block.

```java
int day = 3;
String dayType = switch (day) {
    case 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -> "Weekday"; // "Weekday"
    case 6, 7 -> "Weekend";
    default -> "Invalid day";
};
System.out.println(dayType); // "Weekday"

// Using yield for more complex logic within a case
String dayName = switch (day) {
    case 1 -> "Monday";
    case 2 -> "Tuesday";
    case 3 -> {
        // Can have multiple statements
        System.out.println("Calculating day name...");
        yield "Wednesday"; // "Wednesday"
    }
    default -> "Unknown";
};
System.out.println(dayName); // "Wednesday"
```

## When to Use Switch vs. If-Else

- **Use `switch`** when you have a single variable to compare against multiple, distinct, constant values (integers, enums, or strings). It's often more readable than a long chain of `if-else if` statements.
- **Use `if-else`** for more complex conditions, such as checking ranges, multiple variables, or conditions that are not based on a single value.

### Example: Choosing `if-else`

```java
int score = 85;

if (score >= 90) {
    System.out.println("A");
} else if (score >= 80) {
    System.out.println("B"); // "B"
} else if (score >= 70) {
    System.out.println("C");
} else {
    System.out.println("D");
}
```
