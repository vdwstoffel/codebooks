# Loops in Java

Loops are a fundamental control structure in programming that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. Java provides several types of loops to handle different scenarios.

## 1. The `for` Loop

The `for` loop is ideal when you know in advance how many times you want to execute a block of code. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and update.

```java
// Structure: for (initialization; condition; update)

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    // This block will execute 5 times
    // i will be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
}
```

### Example: Printing numbers

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    // System.out.println(i);
} 
// Output:
// 1
// 2
// 3
```

## 2. The `for-each` Loop (Enhanced `for` Loop)

The `for-each` loop provides a simpler, more readable way to iterate over all elements of an array or a collection. You don't need to manage an index variable.

```java
String[] fruits = {"Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"};

for (String fruit : fruits) {
    // System.out.println(fruit);
}
// Output:
// Apple
// Banana
// Cherry
```

## 3. The `while` Loop

The `while` loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is `true`. It's used when you don't know the exact number of iterations beforehand.

```java
int i = 0;

while (i < 3) {
    // System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}
// Output:
// 0
// 1
// 2
```

**Caution:** Be careful to update the loop variable (`i++`) to avoid an infinite loop.

## 4. The `do-while` Loop

The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but with one key difference: the code block is **always executed at least once** before the condition is checked.

```java
int i = 5;

do {
    // This block executes once, even though i is not less than 5.
    // System.out.println(i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
// Output:
// 5
```

## Loop Control Statements

Java provides two statements to control the flow of loops.

### `break`

The `break` statement immediately terminates the loop and transfers execution to the statement following the loop.

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i == 3) {
        break; // Exit the loop when i is 3
    }
    // System.out.println(i);
}
// Output:
// 0
// 1
// 2
```

### `continue`

The `continue` statement skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next one.

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i == 2) {
        continue; // Skip this iteration when i is 2
    }
    // System.out.println(i);
}
// Output:
// 0
// 1
// 3
// 4
```
