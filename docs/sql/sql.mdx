# SQL

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standard language for managing and manipulating databases. It's used to perform tasks such as retrieving, updating, inserting, and deleting data in a relational database.

SQL is essential for anyone working with data, from data analysts and scientists to software engineers and database administrators.

## Key Concepts

SQL commands are divided into several categories:

- **Data Query Language (DQL):** Used to retrieve data from the database.
  - `SELECT`: The most common DQL command, used to fetch data from one or more tables.
- **Data Definition Language (DDL):** Used to define and manage the database structure.
  - `CREATE`: Creates new tables, databases, or other database objects.
  - `ALTER`: Modifies the structure of an existing database object.
  - `DROP`: Deletes existing database objects.
- **Data Manipulation Language (DML):** Used for adding, deleting, and modifying data in the database.
  - `INSERT`: Adds new records to a table.
  - `UPDATE`: Modifies existing records in a table.
  - `DELETE`: Removes records from a table.
- **Data Control Language (DCL):** Used to manage user access and permissions.
  - `GRANT`: Gives users access privileges to the database.
  - `REVOKE`: Withdraws user access privileges.

## SQLite

For local development and learning, SQLite is a lightweight, serverless database that's easy to set up.

- **Install SQLite:**
  ```bash
  sudo apt install sqlite3
  ```

- **Create a new database:**
  ```bash
  sqlite3 demo.db
  ```

- **Run an SQL script:**
  ```bash
  sqlite3 demo.db < create_table.sql
  ```
