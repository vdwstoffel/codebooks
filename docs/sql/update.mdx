# UPDATE Statement

The `UPDATE` statement is used to modify existing records in a table. It allows you to change the data in one or more columns for records that match a specified condition.

## Basic Syntax

The basic structure of an `UPDATE` query is as follows:

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET
  column1 = value1,
  column2 = value2,
  ...
WHERE
  condition;
```

- `UPDATE table_name`: Specifies the table you want to modify.
- `SET column1 = value1, ...`: Lists the columns to update and their new values.
- `WHERE condition`: Determines which records to update. If you omit the `WHERE` clause, **all records in the table will be updated!**

:::danger Be Careful
Always use a `WHERE` clause with your `UPDATE` statements. Forgetting it can lead to unintended data loss by modifying every row in the table.

## Updating a Single Record

To update a specific record, use a `WHERE` clause that uniquely identifies that record, typically using a primary key or another unique identifier.

```sql
-- Update a user's name based on their original name
UPDATE "users"
SET
  "name" = 'John Strong'
WHERE
  "name" = 'John Doe';
```

## Updating Multiple Columns

You can update multiple columns at once by separating the column-value pairs with a comma in the `SET` clause.

```sql
-- Update a user's subscription status and age
UPDATE "users"
SET
  "subscribed" = true,
  "age" = 35
WHERE
  "email" = 'sally@hotmail.com';
```

## Updating Multiple Records

You can update multiple records that meet a specific condition by using a broader `WHERE` clause.

```sql
-- Unsubscribe all users over 40
UPDATE "users"
SET
  "subscribed" = false
WHERE
  "age" > 40;
```

## Updating All Records

If you need to apply a change to every record in a table, you can omit the `WHERE` clause. **Use this with extreme caution.**

```sql
-- WARNING: This will update every record in the table.
UPDATE "users"
SET
  "subscribed" = true;
```
