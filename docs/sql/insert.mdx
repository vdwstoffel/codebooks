# INSERT INTO Statement

The `INSERT INTO` statement is used to add new records to a table in a database. You can use it to insert a single row or multiple rows at a time.

## Basic Syntax

There are two primary ways to use the `INSERT INTO` statement:

1.  **Specify both column names and values:** This is the recommended approach because it makes the query more readable and less prone to errors if the table structure changes.

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3)
    VALUES (value1, value2, value3);
    ```

2.  **Provide only the values:** If you are adding values for all the columns in the table in the same order as they are defined, you do not need to specify the column names.

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO table_name
    VALUES (value1, value2, value3);
    ```

## Inserting a Single Record

Hereâ€™s how to insert a single record into the `users` table, specifying the columns you want to provide values for.

```sql
INSERT INTO "users" ("name", "email", "age", "password", "subscribed")
VALUES
  ('John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com', 31, 'securepassword123', false);
```

## Inserting Multiple Records

You can insert multiple records in a single query by separating the value tuples with commas.

```sql
INSERT INTO "users" ("name", "email", "age", "password", "subscribed")
VALUES
  ('Mike Meyers', 'mike@gmail.com', 29, '123123123', true),
  ('Jane Thyme', 'thyme@gmail.com', 47, '111111', true),
  ('Sally Smith', 'sally@hotmail.com', 22, '222222', false),
  ('Tom Jones', 'jones@email.com', 33, '333333', true);
```

## Inserting Data from Another Table

You can also use `INSERT INTO` to copy rows from one table and insert them into another. The `INSERT INTO SELECT` statement copies data from a source table and inserts it into a destination table. The data types in the source and destination tables must match.

Let's say you have a `new_users` table and you want to copy all users older than 30 from the `users` table.

```sql
INSERT INTO "new_users" ("name", "email", "age")
SELECT
  "name",
  "email",
  "age"
FROM "users"
WHERE
  "age" > 30;
```
