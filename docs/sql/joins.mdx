# Joins

SQL JOINs are used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

Let's use two simple tables for our examples: `Customers` and `Orders`.

**Customers Table:**

| id | name    | country |
|----|---------|---------|
| 1  | Alice   | USA     |
| 2  | Bob     | Canada  |
| 3  | Charlie | UK      |
| 4  | David   | USA     |

**Orders Table:**

| order_id | cust_id | product  |
|----------|---------|----------|
| 101      | 1       | Laptop   |
| 102      | 2       | Phone    |
| 103      | 1       | Tablet   |
| 104      | 5       | Keyboard |
| 105      | 3       | Mouse    |

## INNER JOIN

An `INNER JOIN` returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables. It's the most common type of join.

**Concept:** Only customers who have placed orders AND orders that belong to an existing customer will be included.

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT Customers.name, Orders.product
FROM Customers
INNER JOIN Orders ON Customers.id = Orders.cust_id;
```

**Result:**

| name    | product  |
|---------|----------|
| Alice   | Laptop   |
| Alice   | Tablet   |
| Bob     | Phone    |
| Charlie | Mouse    |

## LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)

A `LEFT JOIN` returns all rows from the left table (first table in `FROM` clause), and the matching rows from the right table. If there's no match in the right table, `NULL` values are returned for columns from the right table.

**Concept:** All customers will be listed. If a customer has placed an order, their order details will be shown. If a customer has not placed any orders, the `product` column will show `NULL`.

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT Customers.name, Orders.product
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.id = Orders.cust_id;
```

**Result:**

| name    | product  |
|---------|----------|
| Alice   | Laptop   |
| Alice   | Tablet   |
| Bob     | Phone    |
| Charlie | Mouse    |
| David   | NULL     |

---

## RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)

A `RIGHT JOIN` returns all rows from the right table (second table in `FROM` clause), and the matching rows from the left table. If there's no match in the left table, `NULL` values are returned for columns from the left table.

**Concept:** All orders will be listed. If an order belongs to an existing customer, their name will be shown. If an order does not belong to an existing customer (e.g., `cust_id` 5 in our `Orders` table), the `name` column will show `NULL`.

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT Customers.name, Orders.product
FROM Customers
RIGHT JOIN Orders ON Customers.id = Orders.cust_id;
```

**Result:**

| name    | product  |
|---------|----------|
| Alice   | Laptop   |
| Bob     | Phone    |
| Alice   | Tablet   |
| NULL    | Keyboard |
| Charlie | Mouse    |

## FULL OUTER JOIN (or FULL JOIN)

A `FULL OUTER JOIN` returns all rows when there is a match in either the left or the right table. It returns all rows from both tables, with `NULL` values for columns where there is no match.

**Concept:** This join combines the results of both `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN`. It will list all customers and all orders. If a customer has no orders, the order details will be `NULL`. If an order has no matching customer, the customer details will be `NULL`.

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT Customers.name, Orders.product
FROM Customers
FULL OUTER JOIN Orders ON Customers.id = Orders.cust_id;
```

**Result:**

| name    | product  |
|---------|----------|
| Alice   | Laptop   |
| Alice   | Tablet   |
| Bob     | Phone    |
| Charlie | Mouse    |
| David   | NULL     |
| NULL    | Keyboard |
