# SQL Joins

SQL JOINs are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. They are fundamental for querying data from a relational database where data is normalized across multiple tables.

## Table Aliases

Before diving into the different types of joins, it's helpful to understand table aliases. Aliases provide a temporary, shorter name for tables, making queries more concise and readable, especially in complex joins.

```sql
SELECT
  c.name,
  o.product
FROM Customers AS c
INNER JOIN Orders AS o
  ON c.id = o.cust_id;
```

In this example, `c` is an alias for `Customers` and `o` is an alias for `Orders`.

## Example Tables

Let's use two simple tables for our examples: `Customers` and `Orders`.

**Customers Table:**

| id | name    | country |
|----|---------|---------|
| 1  | Alice   | USA     |
| 2  | Bob     | Canada  |
| 3  | Charlie | UK      |
| 4  | David   | USA     |

**Orders Table:**

| order_id | cust_id | product  |
|----------|---------|----------|
| 101      | 1       | Laptop   |
| 102      | 2       | Phone    |
| 103      | 1       | Tablet   |
| 104      | 5       | Keyboard |
| 105      | 3       | Mouse    |

## INNER JOIN

An `INNER JOIN` returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables. It's the most common type of join.

**Concept:** Retrieves records where the key exists in both the `Customers` and `Orders` tables.

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT
  c.name,
  o.product
FROM Customers AS c
INNER JOIN Orders AS o
  ON c.id = o.cust_id;
```

**Result:**

| name    | product  |
|---------|----------|
| Alice   | Laptop   |
| Alice   | Tablet   |
| Bob     | Phone    |
| Charlie | Mouse    |

---

## LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)

A `LEFT JOIN` returns all rows from the left table (`Customers`) and the matching rows from the right table (`Orders`). If there's no match, `NULL` is returned for columns from the right table.

**Concept:** Get all customers, and the orders they've placed, if any.

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT
  c.name,
  o.product
FROM Customers AS c
LEFT JOIN Orders AS o
  ON c.id = o.cust_id;
```

**Result:**

| name    | product  |
|---------|----------|
| Alice   | Laptop   |
| Alice   | Tablet   |
| Bob     | Phone    |
| Charlie | Mouse    |
| David   | NULL     |

---

## RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)

A `RIGHT JOIN` returns all rows from the right table (`Orders`) and the matching rows from the left table (`Customers`). If there's no match, `NULL` is returned for columns from the left table.

**Concept:** Get all orders, and the customer who placed them, if the customer exists.

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT
  c.name,
  o.product
FROM Customers AS c
RIGHT JOIN Orders AS o
  ON c.id = o.cust_id;
```

**Result:**

| name    | product  |
|---------|----------|
| Alice   | Laptop   |
| Bob     | Phone    |
| Alice   | Tablet   |
| NULL    | Keyboard |
| Charlie | Mouse    |

---

## FULL OUTER JOIN

A `FULL OUTER JOIN` returns all rows when there is a match in either the left or the right table. It's a combination of `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN`.

**Concept:** Get all customers and all orders, linking them where possible.

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT
  c.name,
  o.product
FROM Customers AS c
FULL OUTER JOIN Orders AS o
  ON c.id = o.cust_id;
```

**Result:**

| name    | product  |
|---------|----------|
| Alice   | Laptop   |
| Alice   | Tablet   |
| Bob     | Phone    |
| Charlie | Mouse    |
| David   | NULL     |
| NULL    | Keyboard |

## SELF JOIN

A `SELF JOIN` is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself. This is useful for querying hierarchical data or comparing rows within the same table.

Let's use an `Employees` table for this example:

**Employees Table:**

| id | name    | manager_id |
|----|---------|------------|
| 1  | John    | 3          |
| 2  | Jane    | 3          |
| 3  | Mike    | NULL       |
| 4  | Sarah   | 1          |

**Concept:** Find the manager for each employee.

```sql
SELECT
  e.name AS employee_name,
  m.name AS manager_name
FROM Employees AS e
LEFT JOIN Employees AS m
  ON e.manager_id = m.id;
```

**Result:**

| employee_name | manager_name |
|---------------|--------------|
| John          | Mike         |
| Jane          | Mike         |
| Mike          | NULL         |
| Sarah         | John         |
```
