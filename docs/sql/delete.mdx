# DELETE Statement

The `DELETE` statement is used to remove existing records from a table. You can use it to delete a single row, multiple rows, or all rows in a table.

## Basic Syntax

The basic structure of a `DELETE` query is as follows:

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE
  condition;
```

- `DELETE FROM table_name`: Specifies the table from which to delete records.
- `WHERE condition`: Determines which records to delete. If you omit the `WHERE` clause, **all records in the table will be deleted!**

:::danger Be Careful
Always use a `WHERE` clause with your `DELETE` statements unless you intend to remove every record. Forgetting it can lead to irreversible data loss.

## Deleting Specific Records

To delete specific records, use a `WHERE` clause that identifies the rows you want to remove.

- **Delete a single record:**

  ```sql
  DELETE FROM "users"
  WHERE
    "email" = 'mike@gmail.com';
  ```

- **Delete records with multiple conditions:**

  ```sql
  DELETE FROM "users"
  WHERE
    "age" > 30
    AND "subscribed" = false;
  ```

- **Delete records within a range:**

  ```sql
  DELETE FROM "users"
  WHERE
    "age" BETWEEN 20 AND 30;
  ```

## Deleting All Records

To delete all records from a table, you can omit the `WHERE` clause. This action cannot be undone.

```sql
-- WARNING: This will delete every record in the table.
DELETE FROM "users";
```
