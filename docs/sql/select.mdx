# SELECT

## Select all columns

```sql
SELECT * FROM "users";
```

## Select specific columns

```sql
SELECT "name", "email" FROM "users";
```

## Select unique records

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "age" FROM "users"
```

## Select records with a condition

```sql
SELECT * FROM "users"
WHERE "subscribed" = 'true';
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM "users"
WHERE "age" > 30;
```

## Select records with multiple conditions

```sql
SELECT * FROM "users"
WHERE "subscribed" = 'false'
AND "age" < 40;
```

## Select within range

```sql
SELECT * FROM "users"
WHERE "age" BETWEEN 18 AND 30;
```

## Order Results

```sql
SELECT * FROM "users"
ORDER BY "name" ASC;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM "users"
ORDER BY "name" DESC;
```

## Limit Results

```sql
SELECT * FROM "users"
LIMIT 3;
```

## Selecting Patterns

`%` : Zero, one, or multiple characters

`_` : Single character

```sql
SELECT * FROM "users"
WHERE "email" LIKE '%@gmail.com';
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM "users"
WHERE "name" LIKE 'J%';
```

## Grouping Results

Imagine you have a table called Sales that looks like this:
| Product | Category | Quantity | Price |
|---------|----------|----------|-------|
| Laptop | Electronics | 5 | 1000 |
| Smartphone | Electronics | 10 | 800 |
| Chair | Furniture | 7 | 120 |
| Table | Furniture | 4 | 200 |

```sql
SELECT Category, SUM(Quantity) AS TotalQuantity
FROM Sales
GROUP BY Category;
```

The result of this query will be:

| Category    | TotalQuantity |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| Electronics | 15            |
| Furniture   | 11            |
