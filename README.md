# Codebook

This is a Docusaurus project that serves as a personal codebook and reference for various programming topics. It contains code examples and explanations for different languages, frameworks, and libraries.

## Getting Started

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Start Development Server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This will start the development server and open the site in your browser at `http://localhost:9080`.

3.  **Build for Production:**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served by any static content host.

## How to Add a New Category (Tab)

To add a new category (which appears as a tab in the navigation bar) and its associated content, follow these steps:

1.  **Create a New Folder and MDX File:**

    In the `docs` folder, create a new subfolder for your category (e.g., `docs/new-category`). Inside this new folder, create an `.mdx` file (e.g., `docs/new-category/new-category.mdx`). This `.mdx` file will be the main entry point for your new category.

2.  **Update `docusaurus.config.js`:**

    Open `docusaurus.config.js` and locate the `navbar.items` array. Add a new object to this array to define your new tab. For example:

    ```javascript
    {
        type: "dropdown",
        label: "New Category",
        position: "left",
        items: [
            {
                type: "doc",
                label: "New Category Overview",
                docId: "new-category/new-category", // Path to your .mdx file relative to the docs folder
            },
        ],
    },
    ```

    Adjust `label` and `docId` to match your new category.

3.  **Update `sidebars.js`:**

    Open `sidebars.js` and add an entry for your new category to enable autogenerated sidebar items. The `dirName` should point to the folder you created in `docs`.

    ```javascript
    module.exports = {
      // ... other sidebars
      newCategorySidebar: [{ type: "autogenerated", dirName: "new-category" }],
    };
    ```

    Make sure the `newCategorySidebar` key matches the `sidebarId` you might use in your `.mdx` files if you want to link to this sidebar.

Remember to restart the development server (`npm start`) after making these changes to see them reflected.
