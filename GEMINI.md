# About This Project

This is a Docusaurus project that serves as a personal codebook and reference for various programming topics. It contains code examples and explanations for different languages, frameworks, and libraries.

## Project Structure

All examples are in the `docs` folder, separated by language and then by concept.

## Formatting Conventions

- In `.mdx` files, the main heading should be a level 1 heading (`#`).
- All other top-level headings should be level 2 (`##`).
- For React components, use function declarations and default exports (e.g., `export default function MyComponent() { ... }`).

## Key Technologies

- **Docusaurus:** A static site generator for building documentation websites.
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **MDX:** A format that allows writing JSX in Markdown documents.

## Commands

- **`npm start`:** Starts the development server.
- **`npm run build`:** Builds the static site for production.
- **`npm run deploy`:** Deploys the site.

## Content Guidelines

- When providing code examples, focus solely on the technology or concept explicitly requested. Do not introduce 
code from other technologies or frameworks unless specifically instructed to do so by the user.
