# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This is a Docusaurus-based codebook project that serves as a personal reference for programming languages, frameworks, and libraries. It contains code examples, interactive React components, and documentation organized by technology.

## Development Commands

### Essential Commands
- `npm start` - Start development server on port 9000 (accessible at http://localhost:9000)
- `npm run build` - Build for production 
- `npm run serve` - Serve production build on port 9000
- `npm run clear` - Clear Docusaurus cache

### Other Commands
- `npm run swizzle` - Customize Docusaurus components
- `npm run deploy` - Deploy to hosting platform
- `npm run write-translations` - Generate translation files
- `npm run write-heading-ids` - Add heading IDs to markdown files

## Project Architecture

### Core Structure
- **Docusaurus Framework**: Built on Docusaurus 3.7.0 with React 19.0
- **Content Organization**: Documentation organized in language/framework-specific folders under `docs/`
- **Interactive Examples**: Live React components in `src/components/` for demonstrating concepts
- **Auto-generated Navigation**: Sidebars and navigation generated from folder structure

### Key Directories
- `docs/` - Main documentation content organized by language/technology
  - `web-basics/` - HTML, CSS fundamentals
  - `python/`, `javascript/`, `java/`, `cs/`, `dart/` - Language-specific docs
  - `docker/`, `sql/`, `cli/` - Tool-specific documentation
- `src/components/` - Interactive React examples and custom components
  - `reactExamples/` - Demonstratable React hooks, patterns, and libraries
  - `htmlCssExamples/` - Interactive HTML/CSS examples
  - `BrowserWindow/` - Custom wrapper component for displaying examples

### Navigation Configuration
- Navigation defined in `docusaurus.config.js` navbar items array
- Sidebar structure auto-generated via `sidebars.js` with `type: "autogenerated"`
- Each language/technology has its own sidebar configuration

### Interactive Components Architecture
- Examples are live React components that render within the documentation
- `BrowserWindow` component provides consistent styling for examples
- Components organized by category (hooks, patterns, libraries)
- Examples include React Query, Context API, form handling, and mapping libraries

## Key Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- **@docusaurus/core**: Documentation site framework
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management examples
- **react-hook-form**: Form handling examples
- **react-leaflet**: Map component examples
- **axios**: HTTP client examples
- **react-hot-toast**: Toast notification examples

### Syntax Highlighting
Configured Prism languages: bash, docker, yaml, json, typescript, java, csharp, dart, robotframework, pug, groovy

## Adding New Content

### New Language/Technology Category
1. Create folder structure in `docs/[category]/`
2. Add entry to `docusaurus.config.js` navbar dropdown
3. Add sidebar entry to `sidebars.js` with autogenerated type
4. Restart dev server

### Interactive Examples
- Place in appropriate subfolder under `src/components/`
- Use `BrowserWindow` wrapper for consistent presentation
- Import and embed in MDX files using standard JSX syntax
- Follow existing patterns for hooks, context, and state management examples

## Content Organization Philosophy
- Each technology has dedicated namespace
- Examples progress from basic to advanced concepts
- Interactive components demonstrate practical usage
- Documentation focuses on common patterns and snippets rather than comprehensive tutorials

## File Structure Guidelines

### MDX Files
All MDX files should include proper frontmatter:
```yaml
---
sidebar_label: "Display Name"
sidebar_position: [number]
---
```

### Code Examples
- Use descriptive titles for code blocks: `\`\`\`dart title="main.dart"`
- Include minimal, working examples when possible
- Provide context and brief explanations for complex concepts
- Always test code examples before committing
- **Highlight important code**: Use `// highlight-next-line` to draw attention to key lines of code that demonstrate the main concept or feature being explained

### Imports and Components
- Import necessary Docusaurus components at the top of MDX files:
  - `import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";`
  - `import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";`
- Use consistent component imports for interactive examples

## Best Practices

### Code Quality
- Follow language-specific conventions and best practices
- Use proper error handling where applicable
- Handle async operations correctly (e.g., Futures in Dart/Flutter)
- Include necessary imports and dependencies

### Documentation Style
- Keep explanations concise but informative
- Use headings to organize content logically
- Include practical examples that developers can immediately use
- Reference related topics when appropriate

### Maintenance
- Update examples when dependencies change
- Verify all interactive components work after updates
- Keep navigation structure clean and logical
- Regular testing of build process
